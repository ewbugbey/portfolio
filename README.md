## Miami Beach Real Estate Analysis
### Introduction
I chose to analyze Miami Beach real estate data due to my personal interest in real estate investing. Over the past few years, I have worked with a real estate agent to tour places around Miami Beach with the intention of purchasing a rental property. At the time, I didn't do deep-dive analysis on the market trends. Since I never bought anything, I thought it'd be interesting to see what insights I could glean from the data now, looking back.

**Collecting Data**
- I downloaded the Monthly Housing Market Data Crosstab from [Redfin's Data Center](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/), which goes back to 2012.
- Since inflation has been a big factor for me in my investing journey, I also created a .csv of Consumer Price Index data since 2012 from the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/#google_vignette) to see if there were any interesting correlations between market performance and inflation.
- I created tables in a new MySQL database using these two data data sources and then got to preparing the data for analysis.
