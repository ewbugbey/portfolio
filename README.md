## Miami Beach Real Estate Analysis
### Introduction
**Why Miami Beach Real Estate?**
I chose to analyze Miami Beach real estate data due to my personal interest in real estate investing. Over the past few years, I have worked with a real estate agent to tour places around Miami Beach with the intention of purchasing a rental property. I even went to the effort to study for the real estate Sales Associate's license. Since I didn't end up investing at that time, I thought it'd be interesting to see what insights I could glean from the data now, looking back (i.e. make myself feel bad for not pulling the trigger).

**Collecting Data**
- I downloaded the _Monthly Housing Market Data_ from [Redfin's Data Center](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/), going back to 2012.
- Since inflation has been a big factor in my investing journey, I also created a .csv of _Consumer Price Index_ data since 2012 from the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/#google_vignette) to see if there were any interesting correlations between market performance and inflation.
- I created tables in a new _MySQL_ database using these two data data sources and then got to preparing the data for analysis.
